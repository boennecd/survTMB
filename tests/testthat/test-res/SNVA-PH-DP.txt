MGSM estimated with method 'SNVA' with link 'PH' from call:
  make_mgsm_ADFun(formula = Surv(y, uncens) ~ trt, data = eortc, 
      df = 3L, Z = ~1, cluster = as.factor(center), do_setup = "SNVA",

Estimated fixed effects:
                            (Intercept)                                     trt

                                  4.773 

Estimated random effect covariance matrix (correlation matrix) is:
            (Intercept)       (Intercept)
(Intercept)       0.068             0.261
(standard deviations are in the diagonal of the correlation matrix)

Estimated lower bound is -3629.77
