MGSM estimated with method 'Laplace' with link 'PH' from call:
  make_mgsm_ADFun(formula = Surv(y, uncens) ~ trt, data = eortc, 
      df = 3L, Z = ~1, cluster = as.factor(center), do_setup = "Laplace", 
      link = link, n_threads = n_threads)
  fit_mgsm(object = func, method = "Laplace", control = list(reltol = eps))

Estimated fixed effects:
                            (Intercept)                                     trt

nsx(log(y), df = 3, intercept = FALSE)3 
                                 4.7728 

Estimated random effect covariance matrix (correlation matrix) is:
            (Intercept)       (Intercept)
(Intercept)     0.06794            0.2607
(standard deviations are in the diagonal of the correlation matrix)

Estimated log-likelihood is -3629.76
